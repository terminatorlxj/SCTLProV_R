This is the recursive version of the tool `SCTLProV`, named `SCTLProV_R`.

The difference of `SCTLProV` and `SCTLProV_R` is that: unlike `SCTLProV` that performs proof search in a continuation-passing style, `SCTLProV_R` performs proof search all by recursive calls. Note that the recursive style of proof search involves more stack operations, comparing to continuation-passing style.


### Note: `SCTLProV_R` is only a demo tool to show the difference of recursive and continuation-passing style. To do real job, we encourage users to use `SCTLProV`.
